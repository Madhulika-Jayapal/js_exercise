/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Find and display the sum of
 *    a different pair of numbers
 *
 * 2) Change the call to console.log so that
 *    the display on the console reads:
 *    'The sum of 50 and 23 is 73'
 *    using the add function to generate the answer.
 *
 * 3) Can you use the add function as it is
 *    to add more than two numbers?
 *    Hint: You can nest calls to add.
 *
 * 4) Create a function to return the sum of
 *    three numbers given as arguments.
